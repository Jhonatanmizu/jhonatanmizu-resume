# Resume Project

This project provides a streamlined way to manage and tailor your resume for various job applications. It leverages a structured JSON file for your core resume data and a simple HTML template, allowing for easy updates and customization, especially with the help of the Gemini CLI agent.

## Project Structure

*   `resume.json`: This file contains all your resume data in a structured JSON format. It's the single source of truth for your experience, education, skills, and projects.
*   `index.html`: This is the base HTML template for your resume. It's designed to be populated with data from `resume.json`.
*   `output.html`: This file is generated by the Gemini agent. It's a tailored version of your resume, adapted for a specific job description.
*   `GEMINI.md`: This document outlines the advanced workflow for using the Gemini CLI agent to strategically tailor your resume, focusing on recruitment best practices.
*   `css/styles.css`: Contains the styling rules for your HTML resume.

## How It Works

1.  **Data Source (`resume.json`):** Your resume content is stored in a clean, machine-readable JSON format. This separation of content from presentation makes it easy to update your information.
2.  **Base Template (`index.html`):** The `index.html` file acts as a static template. It defines the layout and structure of your resume, which is then populated with data from `resume.json`.
3.  **Tailoring with Gemini (`GEMINI.md` & `output.html`):** The core strength of this project is its integration with the Gemini CLI agent. By providing a job description to the agent, it can:
    *   Analyze the job requirements.
    *   Strategically reorder and rephrase your experiences and skills from `resume.json`.
    *   Generate a new `output.html` file that is highly optimized for that specific job application, without altering your original `index.html` or `resume.json`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Update Your Resume Data

Edit the `resume.json` file with your latest work experience, education, skills, and projects. Ensure all fields are accurately filled out.

### 2. View Your Base Resume

To see your base resume (populated from `resume.json` into `index.html`):

Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### 3. Tailor Your Resume for a Job Application (Using Gemini Agent)

This is the recommended workflow for maximizing your application's impact:

1.  **Prepare the Job Description:** Have the job description for the role you're applying to ready.
2.  **Engage the Gemini Agent:** In your chat with the Gemini CLI agent, provide the job description and instruct it to tailor your resume. For example:
    ```
    Hey Gemini, I'm applying for a [Job Title] role at [Company Name]. Here is the job description: [Paste job description here]. Can you help me tailor my resume for this application?
    ```
3.  **Review `output.html`:** The Gemini agent will generate a new file, `output.html`, in the project directory. This file will contain your resume specifically optimized for that job description.

### 4. Continuous Improvement

Refer to `GEMINI.md` for detailed strategies on how the Gemini agent will approach tailoring your resume, focusing on addressing ATS, recruiter, and hiring manager gaps.

## Customization

*   **Styling:** You can modify `css/styles.css` to change the appearance of your resume.
*   **Template:** If you're familiar with HTML, you can adjust `index.html` to change the overall layout or add new sections, remembering to update `resume.json` if new data fields are introduced.
